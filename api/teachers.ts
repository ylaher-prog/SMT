// VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ERROR: READ THIS
// ======================================================================
//
// This file, `api/teachers.ts`, is conflicting with a file named `api/teachers.tsx`.
// Vercel's build system sees both files and fails because it treats them
// as the same API endpoint.
//
// HOW TO FIX:
// You must DELETE the file `api/teachers.tsx` from your project.
//
// "I already deleted it, but the error is still there!"
// This usually means the deletion was not committed to Git. Please run these commands
// in your terminal:
//
// 1. git status (to check if the deletion is listed)
// 2. git rm api/teachers.tsx (to be sure the file is removed from git)
// 3. git commit -m "Fix: remove conflicting api/teachers.tsx"
// 4. git push
//
// Then, redeploy on Vercel. This should resolve the error.
